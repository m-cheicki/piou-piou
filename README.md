# Piou Piou

üê§PiouPiou is a mobile application that lets you transfer files via sound waves from one smartphone to another.
Unfortunately, we have been running out of time so we could not finish the development of this project.

## How to get the app ?

This mobile app is not on app store and we didn't mean to put it. But you can download it using Expo.

### Prerequisites

-   For Android, go the Google Play Store and install [Expo Go](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent). Once installed, open the app.
-   For iOS, go to App Store and install [Expo Go](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/expo-go/id982107779). Once install, open your camera app.

[Click here to access to the app](https://expo.io/@mcheicki/projects/piou-piou). <br/>
From your mobile device, scan the QR Code from the link above.

## How to use the app ?

### Send a file

-   Choose a file thank to the input on the screen
-   Press the Play Button
-   Wait and enjoy the music generated by your file ;)

### Receive a file

-   Press the Play Button to start recording
-   Once the music played has stopped, press a second time to stop recording
-   Let the app process your file
-   And here you have your file !

## What is actually working today ?

### Send a file

Well, for this part everything seems to work, unless you decide to send a large file.
_How large, you ask ? Well, we don't really know, but don't try to send a file more than 7 kB_

### Receive a file

For this part, we don't have yet the processing of the sound to transform it into a readable file.
